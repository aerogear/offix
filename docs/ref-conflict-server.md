When performing data synchronization between multiple clients it is common for remote devices to become offline for a certain amount of time. As a result of being offline, data that is modified by a client can become outdated with the server. Further operations on that record can cause a conflict (often called a collision).

Offix provides out of the box conflict resolution for any Node.JS platform.
For other languages, you can follow the conflict specification chapter to implement a custom detection mechanism for your resolvers.

## Usage

Install the conflict package inside your Node.js project.

```
npm install offix-conflicts-server
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Prerequisites:

- GraphQL server with resolvers
- Database or any other form of data storage that can cause data conflicts

## Enabling Conflict Resolution

To enable conflict resolution developers need to use one of the pluggable conflict implementations in each individual resolver.

### Version Based Conflict Resolution

1. Add conflict package dependency to project

```javascript
const { conflictHandler } = require('offix-conflicts-server');
```

2. Add version field to GraphQL type that should support conflict resolution

```graphql
type Greeting {
  msg: String
  version: Int
}
```

3. Add example mutations

```graphql
type Mutation {
  changeGreeting(msg: String!, version: Int!): Greeting
}
```

4. Implement resolver for mutation

Every conflict can be handled using a set of predefined steps

```javascript
// 1. Read data from data source
// 2. Check for conflicts
const conflict = conflictHandler.checkForConflicts(serverData, clientData);
if (conflict) {
  throw conflict;
}
// 5. Save object to data source
```

Resolvers can be implemented to handle conflicts on client .

## Implementing Custom Conflict Resolution

The`ObjectState` interface is a complete conflict resolution implementation that provides a set of rules to detect and handle conflicts. The interface will allow developers to handle conflicts on the client. Client-side applications will need to match the server side implementation. Currently, we support the following implementations:

- `VersionObjectState` - allows to operate based on version field in schema
- `HashObjectState` - allows to operate based on object hashes

## Conflict Resolution Specification for other languages

The conflict resolution package can be replicated to any language by implementing conflict detection logic in resolvers.

Conflict detection should return a specific format of error when a conflict has been detected. This error will be processed by offix-client and sent back again as a new mutation. To detect conflicts on the server
you can use one of many strategies, for example:

- Calculate hashes of the data
- Use specialized field like version or lastChangedDate
- Have separate storage with history of the changes

### Structure of the conflict error

The server needs to return a specific error when a conflict is detected
containing both the server and client states:

```js
 "extensions": {
        "code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",
        "exception": {
          "conflictInfo": {
            "serverState": {
                 //..
            },
            "clientState": {
              //..
            }
          },
        }
 }
```
