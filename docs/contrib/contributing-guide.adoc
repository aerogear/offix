== Project Structure
The SDK is made by a group of modules, each one implemented in a different NPM package and all placed under `/packages`.

Each module provides an API to use a particular AeroGear service.

A main package called `core` contains a shared set of interfaces, classes and other functionalities that the rest of modules depend on.

== Working on modules

Modules are written in https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] and tested by https://mochajs.org/[mocha].

Once the development is done, the module is built and the source code is transpiled into a `dist/` folder and published. Typings are automatically generated during this step as well.
