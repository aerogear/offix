 *
 * We first check for a 'local conflict' which happens when the base from the cache is different from
 * the 'version' the operation is trying to mutate.
 * this can happen when the mutation is in flight but the cache was updated by subscriptions
 *
 * If we have no local conflict, we add the original base to the operation's context,
 * which can then be used for conflict resolution later on.
