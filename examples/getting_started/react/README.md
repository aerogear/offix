# Getting started

```
yarn install
```

## Setting up a server

To get started, you will need to set up a GraphQL server. 

You can use the [Graphback runtime example](https://github.com/aerogear/graphback/tree/master/examples/runtime-example), to get
set up quickly.

Configure the GraphQL server address in the config file.

## Starting the client

```
yarn start
```
