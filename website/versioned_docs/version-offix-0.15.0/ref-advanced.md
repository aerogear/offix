# Offix Cookbook

This section contains multiple tips and tricks for working with Offix.


## Implementing Custom Network Status checks

To use your own custom network checks, implement the [NetworkStatus](https://github.com/aerogear/offix/blob/0.15.0/packages/offix-offline/src/network/NetworkStatus.ts)
 interface which provides two functions;

```javascript
  onStatusChangeListener(callback: NetworkStatusChangeCallback): void;

  isOffline(): boolean;
```

This interface can be used to redefine what being offline means. 
For example, for some use cases developers might decide to use scheduler only when Wifi connection is available.

## Querying Data when Offline

To make sure that data will be available when the devices comes back online, we need to query it with the proper 
`fetchPolicy`

We recommend to always use the default fetch policy and to let Offix to control the flow. However, for advanced use cases
developers can modify their approach.
